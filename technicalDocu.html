                    <p>OBS Studio requires the following hardware and operating systems to function. Having a compatible
                    system does not guarantee that it is capable of streaming or recording using OBS. The CPU requirements
                    vary considerably depending on the chosen encoder, resolution, FPS and your scene complexity. Try the
                    Tools-&gt;Auto Configuration Wizard in OBS itself to find appropiate settings for your specs.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Basic Requirements</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Windows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Direct 10.1 compatible GPU</li>
                        <li>Windows 8/8.1/10</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>macOS:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intel CPU (PPC is not supported)</li>
                        <li>OpenGL 3.3 compatible GPU</li>
                        <li>macOS High Sierra (10.13) or later</li>

                    <p>Hardware Encoders</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Hardware encoders are generally recommended for local recordings, but not streaming. They can
                    be a last resort if software encoding is not possible. They offer minimal performance impact in
                    exchange for a reduction in quality at the same bitrates as software(x246) encoding using the
                        default preset of veryfast. Currently, all consumer-level hardware encoders are provided by
                    certain GPUs, as listed below</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Please make sure to use the latest drivers for your GPU:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Intel GPU drivers are usually available from your mainboard manufacturer, but can also be <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html" style="text-decoration: none">found here</a>.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>NVIDEA GeForce GTX-class GPU with Kepler architecture (GKxx) or newer (starting with some cards
                    of GTX 600 series). Support for mobile GPUs can exist, but most will not support NVENC. If you get
                    an error when trying to use the NVENC encoder and your drivers are already up to date, your GPU
                        very likely does not support NVENC</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>Intel HD Graphics GPU on Intel Core-i-CPU 2xxx (Sandy Bridge) or newer.</p>
                    <p>Due to low quality of early iterations of QSV, Intel Core-i-CPU 4xxx (Haswell) or newer is recommended.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>QSV can be unstable on Windows 7 and many require <a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-use-quicksync.82/" style="text-decoration: none">workarounds to enable it</a>.</p>

                <article>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Just follow these <strong>4 steps</strong> to start streaming or recording!</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>1. Run the auto-configuration wizard</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>When you load OBS Studio for the first time you should see the Auto-Configuration Wizard.
                    If you`re new to OBS or just want to get started as quickly as possible, follow the steps to get
                    good starting settings for youir setup. If you only see the main OBS Studio window, you can access the
                    Auto-Config Wizard in the Tools menu at the top. This wizard will automatically test your system and attempt
                    to find settings that your PC can handle. This includes streaming or recording, resolution, bitrate, encoder, streaming
                    provider and more. You can always modify the settings manually later.</ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>2. Set up your audio devices</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By default, OBS Studio is set to capture your system default desktop audio device and microphone. You
                    can verify this by looking at the volume meters in the mixer section omn the main OBS Studio window, and see
                    if they are active. If they aren`t moving, or you suspect the wrong device is being captured, click on
                            Settings-> Audio and select the devices manually.</li>
                        <li><strong>macOS users</strong>. If you`re an macOS, <a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/os-x-capture-audio-with-ishowu-audio-capture.505/" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: none">you`ll need an extra app</a> to capture
                        desktop audio. This is due to limitations in macOS that provide no direct capture methods for desktop
                        audio devices.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>3. Add your sources for video</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Next, you`ll see that the preview is a black screen. OBS does not capture any video by default. To
                        get started capturing, <strong>you need to add a Source</strong>. At the bottom of the window is a box called
                        'Sources'. Click on the + (or right click inside the box) and pick the source you want. As a few examples,
                        select Game Capture if you`re capturing a game, Window for non-game applications, or Video Device for a webcam
                        or capture card.</li>
                        <p></p>

                        our troubleshooting guide if your game/window/display capture sources still show a black screen.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li>Sources and Scenes are the bread and butter of OBS Studio, and can be super powerfull. <a href="https://obsproject.com/wiki/OBS-Studio-Overview#scenes-and-sources" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: none">Click here

                    <p></p>
                    <p>4. Test your stream and record settings</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Double check that all your settings are how you want them in Settings-> Output.<strong>Then, just hit
                        Start Recording or Start Streaming</strong>. We strongly encourage running a test for a few minutes to
                        make sure that there are no issures, rather than just jumping in to your first stream or recording. If you
                        run into any issures, or need further help, take a peek at our <a href="https://obsproject.com/help" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: none">help portal</a>.</li>

                    <p>Where are my recordings saved?</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>Once your recording is done, you can find it using File-> Show Recordings. You can change this in File->
                    Settings->Output->Recording</ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>I need my recordings in MP4!</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>File-> Remux Recordings will quickly and easy convert your video files into MP4.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Help, may video is laggy!</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Depending on the kind of lag, this could be related to a slow internet connection, your game using
                    too many resources, or incorrect settings. Read the troubleshooting guides linked below.</p>

                    <p><strong>First things first:</strong><i> Profiles do not include the scenes and sources!</i></p>

                    <p>To end the confusion</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Many users have complained, that the name <i>profiles</i>might be a bit confusing. Some think it
                    implies the scenes and sources are saved in a profile, but that is not the case. A profile is just for the settings
                        and the scenes and sources are saved in a so <i>called Scene Collection</i>.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>To quote from OBS forum: Many users stream to multiple services, and it`s very useful to simply switch
                        those profile settings rather than having to change entire scene collections. Saving both to the same place is a waste
                        of resources, and this is unlikely to be changed.</li>
